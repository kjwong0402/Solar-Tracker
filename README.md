# Solar-Tracker
A Solar Panel that automatically adjust the angle based on the sun light using an API.

Features
1. Use a weather app API to get the sunlight and sunrise time.
2. Use another API to get the actual time of the day.
3. Compute the angle of the solar panel based on the time of the day.

Hardware
1. Use ESP8266 as a microcontroller.
2. I use a STEP - MOTOR 28BYJ 48. and ULN 2003 motor driver.
3. An external power source for the motor driver and the ESP8266.
4. I use 5V 6W mini solar panel.
